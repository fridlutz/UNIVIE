# the following approach was applied in developing the ontology
# 1. turtle representation of all 3 input xmls developed, namespaces for each team input
# 2. the team18.xml was used as the basis and crosslinking the other team inputs, this can also be done in both directions, this was skipped. Data and queries are written against the base from team18, also translation happens here to German. The cross-linking in only done on element level, not on attribute level, the datasets are mapped to this base.
#-> team18 represents the ontology, the others are mapped to it
