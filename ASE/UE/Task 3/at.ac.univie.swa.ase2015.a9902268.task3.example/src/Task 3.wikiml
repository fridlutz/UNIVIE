==Background==
When ''[[Wikipedia]]'' was first launched in January 2001 (cf. [[History of Wikipedia#Timeline|Timeline of Wikipedia]]), it ran on the existing ''wiki'' software ''[[UseModWiki]]'', 
which was written in ''[[Perl]]'' and stored all ''wiki'' pages in text files. This software soon proved limiting, both in its functionality and its performance. In mid-2001, 
[[Magnus Manske]], a developer and student at the [[University of Cologne|Cologne University]], began working on new software that would replace ''UseModWiki'', specifically for use by ''Wikipedia''. This software was written in ''[[PHP]]'' ([https://secure.php.net/]) and stored all its information in a ''[[MySQL]]'' ([https://www.mysql.com/ www.mysql.com]) database.
<blockquote>This software was referred to as "the ''PHP'' script" and as "phase II", with the name "phase I" retroactively given to the use of ''UseModWiki''.</blockquote>
