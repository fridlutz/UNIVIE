==Background==
When ''[[Wikipedia]]'' was first launched in January 2001 (cf. [[History of WikipediaTimeline|Timeline of Wikipedia]]), it 
ran on the existing ''wiki'' software ''[[UseModWiki]]'', which was written in ''[[Perl]]'' and stored all ''wiki'' pages in 
text files. This software soon proved limiting, both in its functionality and its performance. In mid-2001, [[Magnus Manske]], a
 developer and student at the [[University of Cologne|Cologne University]], began working on new software that would replace
  ''UseModWiki'', specifically for use by ''Wikipedia''. This software was written in ''[[PHP]]'' ([https://secure.php.net/]) and
   stored all its information in a ''[[MySQL]]'' ([https://www.mysql.com/ www.mysql.com]) database.
<blockquote>This software was referred to as "the ''PHP'' script" and as "phase II", with the name "phase I" retroactively given to the use of ''UseModWiki''.</blockquote>

===Milestones===
Major milestones in ''MediaWiki''s development have included (see also [[Version history|below]]):
# the categorization system, added in 2004
#[[Parsing|parser functions]], added in 2006 <!-- COMMENT -->
#[[flagged revisions]], added in 2008
# the "ResourceLoader", a delivery system for [[ Cascading Style Sheets|''CSS'']] and ''[[JavaScript]]'', added in 2011
# the [[VisualEditor]], a [[WYSIWYG]] (What You See Is What You Get) editor, added in 2013
