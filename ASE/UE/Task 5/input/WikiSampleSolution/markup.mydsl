==Background==
When ''[[Wikipedia]]'' was first launched in January 2001 (cf. [[History of WikipediaTimeline|Timeline of Wikipedia]]), it 
ran on the existing ''wiki'' software ''[[UseModWiki]]'', which was written in ''[[Perl]]'' and stored all ''wiki'' pages in 
text files. This software soon proved limiting, both in its functionality and its performance. In mid-2001, [[Magnus Manske]], a
 developer and student at the [[University of Cologne|Cologne University]], began working on new software that would replace
  ''UseModWiki'', specifically for use by ''Wikipedia''. This software was written in ''[[PHP]]'' ([https://secure.php.net/]) and
   stored all its information in a ''[[MySQL]]'' ([https://www.mysql.com/ www.mysql.com]) database.
<blockquote>This software was referred to as "the ''PHP'' script" and as "phase II", with the name "phase I" retroactively given to the use of ''UseModWiki''.</blockquote>
